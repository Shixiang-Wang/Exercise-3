# Exercise-3: A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Hate Speech Detection
## Project Overview
This project is conducted by Shixiang Wang and Tongyu Liu, comparing the performances of three deep learning models for hate speech detection: RNN, LSTM, and BERT. This is a work for Exercise 3.

## Data Resourse
The dataset we used is from the ETHOS Hate Speech Detection Dataset on Github: https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Ethos-Hate-Speech-Dataset

## Results
1. RNN
2. LSTM
3. BERT
